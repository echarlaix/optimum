# Language modeling 

## language modeling

The script [`run_clm.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_clm.py), [`run_mlm.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_mlm.py), and [`run_plm.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_plm.py)
allows us to apply different quantization approach such as dynamic, post-training and quantization aware-training 
using different provider such as [Intel Neural Compressor (INC)](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) for 
language modeling tasks.


The following example applies dynamic quantization on a distilroberta fine-tuned on the wikitext datasets, using the
[`inc`](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) provider: 


```bash
python examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_clm.py \
    --model_name_or_path naram92/distilroberta-base-finetuned-wikitext2 \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --provider inc \
    --quantize \
    --quantization_approach dynamic \
    --do_eval \
    --verify_loading \
    --output_dir /tmp/rembert_output
```

In order to apply dynamic, post-training or aware-training quantization, `quantization_approach` must be set to 
respectively `dynamic`, `static` or `aware_training`.

For post-training static quantization and aware-training quantization, we must [set_config("model.framework", "pytorch_fx")](run_clm.py#L571)

The configuration file can be specified by `config_name_or_path` and contains all the information related 
to the model quantization and tuning objective.  If no `config_name_or_path` is specified, the 
[default config file](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/config/inc/quantization.yml) 
will be used.

The flag `--verify_loading` can be passed along to verify that the resulting quantized model can be loaded correctly.
